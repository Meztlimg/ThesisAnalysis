Here is the code used to ilustrate my PhD thesis called "*In silico* study of metabolic rewiring during epithelial-mesenchymal transition"

It includes mathematical modeling of metabolic rewiring during EMT using metabolomics and transcriptomics data from three Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines **A549, HCC827 and NCI-H358**

These cell lines have different genetic backgrounds, hence we aimed to identify the metabolic similarities among them.
A549 and NCI-H358 have mutations in KRAS, while HCC827 has mutations in EGFR. To find key EMT features, we compared the three cell lines data and found their similarities. 
This protocol analyze Metabolomic data from [Sun Y., *et. al.* 2014](https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-3002-2-20) to infer reactions changing after EMT induction with TGF-$\beta$.
